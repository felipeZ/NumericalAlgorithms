OptimizationAlgorithms
======================

Numerical optimizations are important in numerous fields,and its enormous importance is
testified by the amount of time spent optimizing the libraries in C and Fortran,
where composibility and legibility is usually sacrificed to increase performance, 
chaning all the client applications to monolith and obscure codes. Pure Haskell 
implementation of these functions stands as a safe and fast alternative to create composable tools.

Baked using Haskell without C or Fortran Additives ;)
