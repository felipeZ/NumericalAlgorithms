OptimizationAlgorithms
======================
### Optimizations
Numerical optimizations are important in numerous fields,and its enormous importance is
testified by the amount of time spent optimizing the libraries in C and Fortran,
where composibility and legibility is usually sacrificed to increase performance, 
chaning all the client applications to monolith and obscure codes. Pure Haskell 
implementation of these functions stands as a safe and fast alternative to create composable tools.

### Linear Algebra
There are also some linear algebra utilities, like a function to calculate the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of square symmetry real matrix and also its inverse.   

### How to Use it


Baked using Haskell without C or Fortran Additives ;)
